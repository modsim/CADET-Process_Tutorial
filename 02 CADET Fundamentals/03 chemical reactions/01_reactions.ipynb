    "Since version 4, it is possible to model chemical reactions with CADET using mass action law type reactions (see [Reaction models](https://cadet.github.io/master/modelling/reactions.html#reaction-models)).\n",
    "The mass action law states that the speed of a reaction is proportional to the product of the concentrations of their reactants.\n",
    "\n",
    "In CADET-Process, a reaction module was implemented to facilitate the setup of these reactions.\n",
    "There are two different classes: the `MassActionLaw` which is used for bulk phase reactions, as well as `MassActionLawParticle` which is specifically designed to model reactions in particle pore phase.\n",
